# Election_Analysis

## Overview
The overall purpose of this assignment was to help Seth and Tom complete their election audit, using Python. The goal was to find the voter turnout for each county, the percentage of votes from each county, and the highest turnout. Using repetition statements and conditional statements with logical operators, we wanted to print out the candidate and county election results to the command line and determine the winner based on popular vote. 

## Results
My biggest challenge has been syncing the data in between files into python. Thus, I was unable to print results so far. Will be resubmitting.
